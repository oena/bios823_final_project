To run the dashboard locally, you need all py scripts with prefix `app_` with two auxiliary files: `viz.py` and `cluster.py`. 

The data for the dashboard are all in `dashboard_data` folder. Since the dashboard load data from this github repo, you don't need to download the data to run the dashboard locally.

When you finish downloading all needed py scripts in one folder, you can type `streamlit run app_main.py` in the terminal to run the dashboard locally.
