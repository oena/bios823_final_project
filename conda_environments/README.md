## Conda environments 

These environments are relevant to exploratory analyses and visualizations (so, the files/folders not in the dashboard folder). 

### Setup 

You can re-create these conda environments [after installing conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) as follows:

`> conda env create --file [relevant_environment_name].yml` 

And then you can activate the environment by typing: 

`> conda activate [relevant_enviornment_name]`

More helpful information about conda can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/_downloads/843d9e0198f2a193a3484886fa28163c/conda-cheatsheet.pdf).
